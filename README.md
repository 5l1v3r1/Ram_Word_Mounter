# Ram_Word_Mounter
Loads Wordlists Into a Ramdisk

So, Was playing around, Found you can make a disk on ram with a one line on bash shell

Evil ideas insued :-)

Played around with slapping WORDLISTS into ramdisk, and OH BOY do they spam out keys/ps SO MUCH FASTER.

So, naturally... Automate the boring stuff with Python ;-)

Goal:
Have python create a ramdisk, shove applicable wordlists in that ramdisk

Pipe Dream:
Have python pipe that wordlist directory to other common pentesting programs (John, Hashcat, etc)
